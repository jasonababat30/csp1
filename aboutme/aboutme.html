	    <p>I was born on the 30th of May 1997 in Cagayan De Oro City in which my mother resided. My father's hometown was in Cebu before marrying my mother but decided to reside with here after marriage. There are 3 siblings in my family and I'm the middle-child and the only boy of us three. We were raised just like other ordinary families-- with great love and care. As soon as I hit 7 years old, my parents decided to move to Cebu as our new home. And so, we moved. During the early times in Cebu, it was challenging. City life was new in every cases such as the environment, people's attitude, people's way of communicating, and many more. However, as time progresses, I've adapted to it.

	    <p>In my teenage life, things were as mundane as it can be. I'm not saying life back then was tedious, there were a lot of great times back then. I still consider my teenage life as my glory days so far. But what I'm trying to say about it being mundane is that my experience back then was just like other typical teenagers experience.</p>

	    <p>After graduating HighSchool, I decided to become a seafarer due to the fact that my father is one and the pay was great. And so, I've applied the course of it. Being in college was a whole level from its preceding educational establisment. Back then, I already have gotten the glimpse of how life is. How one must struggle to live in this world. Just by thinking of it, I took my classes seriously. In God's grace and guidance, I've graduated. Not to brag, I've finished with flying colors.</p>

	    <h5 class="mt-0">As a Seafarer</h5>
	    <p>Luckily, after few months after graduation, I've landed my first job being a Cadet in the ship. They say seafarers are carefree with all their money yet they don't know the situation in the ship. The first time was really tough to tell you the truth. You're fighting fatigue, unfixed working schedules, different people's attitude, and more for a whole year. But I never gave up. In far time, I got used to it and it the pressure eases once you've adapted to it. I got home then I go back once again in the ship but I've been promoted. Although majority of the jobs was the same as before, there are some that are advanced. Fortunately, once again, I got used to it due to the fact that I'm a focused person and I don't give up easily.</p>

	    <h5 class="mt-0">Transition to Web Development</h5>
	    <p>As soon as I finished my contract on my last job as a Seafarer, the pandemic COVID-19 strikes. Going back for a job was difficult due to the fact international transportations were held to prevent further spread of the virus. This prompts me to look not just for alternative but outside the box scenario. Then programming came after me. All I can say is that Programming is the future. With the neverending tomorrows and modernization, one must understand the processes and how you can cope up with it. And here I am taking the course at Zuitt Bootcamp. I may never know the future but I'm positive that Programming will reward me from the upcoming time.</p>
